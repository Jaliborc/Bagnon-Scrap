# Bagnon Scrap :moneybag:
Marks all junk items in [Bagnon](https://github.com/tullamods/Bagnon) panels according to [Scrap](https://github.com/Jaliborc/Scrap). Also provides a junk ruleset.
Logically, it requires both [Bagnon](https://github.com/tullamods/Bagnon) and [Scrap](https://github.com/Jaliborc/Scrap) to work.
